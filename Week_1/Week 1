**What is Nodejs?** 

Nodejs is a JavaScript runtime. It means that you can run your JavaScript in other places other than your browser. 

**How do you I install it?** 

Head to [https://nodejs.org]() and grab the packaged file for your operating system. 

**What can you do with it?**

There are ways that you can use nodejs. It can be used for having REST-ful APIs. It's easy to do so with the powerful `express` library. 
We will look into doing a simple API. 

**Getting started**

All you need to know to get started with Nodejs is knowing JaveScript syntax. Let's do a super simple exercise.
 
 
Open your terminal and go to the directory that you created for this lesson. 
Create a file called `hello.js`. You can use `nano` command to create a new file.

```
nano hello.js
```

Open it in your editor. Add the following in that file: 

``` 
console.log('hello world');
```

Save the file and run the following command: 

```
node hello.js
```

You should get the following output: 

```
hello world
```

You now have done a `hello world` program in nodejs.
